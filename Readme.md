# README

This README provides a step-by-step guide to create and run an AWS Step Function that orchestrates a Spark job using Amazon EMR, S3, and Step Functions. This guide is designed for users of all experience levels, including freshers.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- IAM Role with necessary permissions
- Spark code ready to be executed

## Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket and Necessary Folders

1. **Log in to the AWS Management Console**.
2. **Navigate to the S3 Service**:
   - In the search bar, type "S3" and select "S3" from the results.

3. **Create an S3 Bucket**:
   - Click on the "Create bucket" button.
   - Enter a unique name for your bucket (e.g., `your-bucket-name`).
   - Choose the region where you want to create the bucket.
   - Click "Create bucket" at the bottom of the page.

4. **Create Folders in the S3 Bucket**:
   - Click on your newly created bucket to open it.
   - Click the "Create folder" button.
   - Name the folder `input` and click "Create folder".
   - Repeat the process to create `output`, `logs`, and `scripts` folders.

## Step 2: Upload Files to S3

1. **Upload Your Spark Code**:
   - Navigate to the `scripts` folder in your bucket.
   - Click the "Upload" button.
   - Click "Add files" and select your Spark script (e.g., `spark-job.py`).
   - Click "Upload" at the bottom of the page.

2. **Upload Your Input Data**:
   - Navigate to the `input` folder in your bucket.
   - Click the "Upload" button.
   - Click "Add files" and select your CSV file (e.g., `data.csv`).
   - Click "Upload" at the bottom of the page.

## Step 3: Create an EMR Cluster

1. **Navigate to the EMR Service**:
   - In the search bar, type "EMR" and select "EMR" from the results.

2. **Create a Cluster**:
   - Click the "Create cluster" button.
   - In the "Cluster configuration" section, select "Go to advanced options".
   - Choose "Release" and "Applications" as required (e.g., `emr-6.x` and `Spark`).
   - Click "Next".

3. **Configure the Cluster**:
   - In the "Hardware" section, configure the instance types and number of instances.
   - Click "Next".

4. **Add Steps**:
   - Under "Steps", click "Add step".
   - Choose "Spark application" as the step type.
   - Provide the path to your Spark script in the `scripts` folder (e.g., `s3://your-bucket-name/scripts/spark-job.py`).
   - Specify any required arguments.
   - Click "Add" and then "Next".

5. **Security and Access**:
   - Configure the security settings as per your requirements.
   - Click "Create cluster" to launch the cluster.

## Step 4: Create an AWS Step Function

1. **Navigate to the Step Functions Service**:
   - In the search bar, type "Step Functions" and select "Step Functions" from the results.

2. **Create a State Machine**:
   - Click the "Create state machine" button.
   - Choose "Design your workflow visually".
   - Click "Next".

3. **Define the Workflow**:
   - Add the necessary states to create and monitor the EMR cluster and steps.
   - Use the built-in states such as `CreateCluster`, `AddStep`, `MonitorStep`, and `TerminateCluster`.

4. **Configure State Machine Details**:
   - Provide a name for your state machine (e.g., `EMR-Spark-StepFunction`).
   - Choose "Permissions" to define the IAM role for Step Functions to access EMR and S3.
   - Click "Create state machine".

## Step 5: Run the Step Function

1. **Start Execution**:
   - Navigate to your newly created state machine.
   - Click "Start execution".
   - Provide the necessary input JSON (e.g., paths to the input and output folders).
   - Click "Start execution".

2. **Monitor the Execution**:
   - Monitor the progress and execution of the state machine.
   - Ensure the Spark job completes successfully and outputs are stored in the `output` folder.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you have successfully created and run an AWS Step Function to orchestrate a Spark job using Amazon EMR and S3. You can monitor and manage your workflow through the AWS Management Console.
